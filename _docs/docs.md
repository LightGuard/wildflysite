**Welcome to the WildFly Documentation. The documentation for WildFly is split into two categories:**

-   _Administrator Guides_  for those wanting to understand how to install and configure the server.
    
-   _Developer Guides_  for those wanting to understand how to develop applications for the server.

There is also the [WildFly Model Reference](http://wildscribe.github.io/) that provides information about all subsystem configuration options generated directly from the management model.

## Administrator Guides

-   The  [Getting Started Guide](http://docs.wildfly.org/13/Getting_Started_Guide.html)  shows you how to install and start the server, how to configure logging, how to deploy an application, how to deploy a datasource, and how to get started using the command line interface and web management interface
    
-   The  [Admin Guide](http://docs.wildfly.org/13/Admin_Guide.html)  provides detailed information on using the CLI and Web Management interface, how to use the domain configuration, and shows you how to configure key subsystems
    
-   The  [High Availability Guide](http://docs.wildfly.org/13/High_Availability_Guide.html)  shows you how to create a cluster, how configure the web container and EJB container for clustering, and shows you how to configure load balancing and failover

## Developer Guides

-   The  [Getting Started Developing Applications Guide](http://docs.wildfly.org/13/Getting_Started_Developing_Applications_Guide.html)  shows you how to build Java EE applications and deploy them to WildFly. The guide starts by showing you the simplest  _helloworld_  application using just Servlet and CDI, and then adds in JSF, persistence and transactions, EJB, Bean Validation, RESTful web services and more. Finally, youâ€™ll get the opportunity to create your own skeleton project. Each tutorial is accompanied by a quickstart, which contains the source code, deployment descriptors and a Maven based build.
    
-   The  [Developer Guide](http://docs.wildfly.org/13/Developer_Guide.html)  (  _in progress_) takes you through every deployment descriptor and every annotation offered by WildFly.
    
-   The  [JavaEE Tutorial](http://docs.wildfly.org/13/JavaEE_Tutorial.html)  (  _in progress_) builds on what you learnt in the[Getting Started Developing Applications Guide](http://docs.wildfly.org/13/Getting_Started_Developing_Applications_Guide.html), and shows you how to build a complex application using Java EE and portable extensions.
    
-   The  [Extending WildFly](http://docs.wildfly.org/13/Extending_WildFly.html)  guide walks you through creating a new WildFly subsystem extension, in order to add more functionality to WildFly, and shows how to test it before plugging it into WildFly.
    
-   The  [WildFly Testsuite](http://docs.wildfly.org/13/Testsuite.html)  guide walks you trough testing WildFly
    

## Security Guide

The [WildFly Elytron Security](http://docs.wildfly.org/13/WildFly_Elytron_Security.html)  guide walks you trough new security layer of of WildFly
    

## Client Guide

The [WildFly Client Configuration](http://docs.wildfly.org/13/Client_Guide.html)  guide walks you trough new wildfly client and how to use it.
    

## Quickstarts

WildFly comes with a number of quickstarts, examples which introduce to a particular technology or feature of the application server. The  [Contributing a Quickstart](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONTRIBUTING.md#contribute-a-quickstart)  section of the documentation details the available quickstarts
